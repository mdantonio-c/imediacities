    <strong>3. Cookies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Every time a user visits the website, that visit will be registered by
    means of so-called ‘cookies’. Cookies are small files that are stored on
    the user’s hard drive, which allow the I-Media-Cities Consortium to access
    information about the use of their website and which allows for
    preferences, user names and passwords to be automatically remembered. This
    information can also be analyzed to discover trends and draw statistics
    relating to such things as the parts of the website that are most visited,
    average time of a visit, etc. In order to do this, I-Media-Cities will use
    Google Analytics (on which the
    <u>

<p>
    The information that is collected through cookies can only be coupled to a
    computer and not to a specific user. It will therefore not allow the
    I-Media-Cities Consortium to derive any conformation that reveals the
    identity of a user. You have the ability to format your browser in such a
    way that cookies are refused. By doing this, it is possible that the
    website will no longer function optimally.
