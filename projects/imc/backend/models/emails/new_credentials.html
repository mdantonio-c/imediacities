Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I-Media-Cities is <b>an ambitious and innovative research project</b> led by 9 European cultural institutions (film and audiovisual archives from 8 countries), <b>to share, provide access to, and use their digital content</b>, turning it into the lever of novel approaches to multidisciplinary research, to business innovation <b>and to the overall accessibility of the European cultural heritage</b>. As an experimental innovation action, the project focuses on the digital content that refers to <b>cities</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past months we created <b>a first test version</b> of <b>our online platform</b> which will guide you as an user through all the available content.<br/>
<br/>
You as a researcher or an archivist are key to the success of this platform and therefore we would like to ask <b>30 minutes of your precious time</b> to try out the platform and provide us with valuable feedback which will empower us to make further improvements.<br/>
<br/>
To align your feedback we created <b>a small test scenario and</b> we want to <b>ask you a couple of questions</b> afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
To log in you can use following credentials:<br/>
<br/>
<i>User name: %%username%%</i><br/>
<i>Password: %%password%%<i><br/>
<br/>
<b>Interested to help us shape this platform to your size?</b><br/>
