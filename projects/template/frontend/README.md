## Template for a frontend application

Rapydo has been created to quickly provide HTTP API servers.

Usually the HTTP API at some point requires some Portal with Javascript and HTML5 web pages to connect with.

If you need such feature you can base your web server on this template.

What is already provided:

1. HTML5 and CSS3 based on `bootstrap`
2. Authentication mechanism against the `/api/login` HTTP base endpoint (login/logout)
3. Profile page once authenticated
4. A welcome page as a template to new web pages
